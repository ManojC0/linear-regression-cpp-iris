# Iris Linear Regression with Gradient Descent (C++ and Python)
This project implements a simple linear regression model using gradient descent from scratch using C++, applied to the Iris dataset across all 3 plant species.
The regression line is visualised in Python using matplotlib. 

## What I did
- C++ implementation of gradient descent.
- Use 1 feature (sepal length) to predict another (petal length).
- Visualise predictions.

## What I learned
- C++ CSV file handling.
- Overloading C++ operators (e.g., >>).
- Mathematics behind gradient descent.

## What I'd do next
- Support more features (multiple linear regression).
- Test the gradient descent function on other datasets.

# Dataset
- Iris Dataset: A dataset containing the sepal/petal length & width for 3 plant species.
- I used on 2 numerical columns in the project, the sepal length and the petal length.

The dataset is included in /data/iris.csv for convenience.
